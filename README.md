### Who am I?

Hello! My name is Miruna Barbu and I am a Research Fellow in the Divison of Psychiatry at the University of Edinburgh, United Kingdom. I am working on my own fellowship at the moment. 
I work on associations between genetic and epigenetic risk factors for psychiatric disorders (Major Depressive Disorder and Schizophrenia specifically) and imaging-, environmental-, and clinical phenotypes. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
### What have I worked on?

My work has focussed on the following analyses:

- genome-wide association study
- epigenome-wide association study
- polygenic risk scoring
- methylation risk scoring 
- risk prediction modelling (using linear, logistic, and ordinal regression)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Competences

I mainly work in **R** and produce code for **Linux-based environments**. I also have some beginner experience in **Python**.
I am competent in using RMarkdown and frequently utilise this to present my results at departmental meetings and to external collaborators.

### About "Code Portfolio"

The "Code Portfolio" repository contains code I have produced throughout my PhD studies and employment. 

Each sub-directory contains a "README" file containing information about the code and output contained in the directory.
