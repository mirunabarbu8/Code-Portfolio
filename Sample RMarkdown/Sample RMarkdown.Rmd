### A sample RMarkdown title

This RMarkdown file is a sample to demonstrate how to create results/data presentation in this mode. I created this file as a tutorial for a new student starting out in our department, to get her started on the basics of RMarkdown.

##### Example of an image presentation in RMarkdown

The image below was obtained from [Google Images](https://www.google.com/search?q=puppies&sxsrf=APq-WBsvg2UEhJzz0R4VDsZAcSuQwMdCKA:1646054927337&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjJxeW5wKL2AhWEUcAKHdgYDVUQ_AUoAXoECAMQAw&biw=1320&bih=769&dpr=2.5#imgrc=Xlf4qHwbPczmKM).

```{r pressure imag3, echo=FALSE,fig.align="center", out.width = '60%'}
knitr::include_graphics("./puppies.jpg")
```

##### Example of a table presentation in RMarkdown

The table below is one created for the purposes of this document. It uses "pander" to display the table in RMarkdown. It presents the size of 5 dog breeds, randomly selected from [here](https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/nutrition/breed-weight-chart/).

```{r Dog breed N, echo=FALSE}
dog_breed=matrix(c("German Shepherd","Basset hound","Bulldogs","Dalmatians","Pugs","50-70 pounds","40-65 pounds","40 pounds","45-70 pounds","14-18 pounds","65-90 pounds","40-65 pounds","50 pounds	","45-70 pounds","14-18 pounds"),nrow=5,ncol=3)
colnames(dog_breed)[1:3]<-c("Dog breed","Female size","Male size")

pander(dog_breed, caption="Female and Male size across 5 dog breeds.")

```

##### Sample of data analysis & results

The script below contains a simple analysis (food consumption in kg based on dog size) used to illustrate how to conduct analysis and present results in an RMarkdown file. All data was created simply for the purpose of this tutorial.

```{r data analysis & results, echo=FALSE,message=FALSE}
# Create dummy data
dog_size_food=data.frame(matrix(runif(50, min=0, max=100)))
dog_size_food$dog_size=sample(c(0,1), replace=TRUE, size=50)
colnames(dog_size_food)[1:2]<-c("food_consump","dog_size")
# 0=small size, 1=large size
dog_size_food$dog_size=as.factor(dog_size_food$dog_size)

# Run linear model
fit=summary(lm(food_consump~dog_size, data=dog_size_food))

# Extract results
fit_res <- fit$coefficients[c(1,2),]
fit_res=as.data.frame(fit_res)
fit_res$result=c("Intercept","Food consumption as a function of dog size")

# Provide table with significant results highlighted
color.me <- which(fit_res$`Pr(>|t|)` < 0.05)

# Turn all numeric columns to character JUST for display of table
fit_res=fit_res %>% mutate_if(is.numeric,as.character)

# We create a table that highlights all significant findings in green - in this case, the intercept.
fit_res %>% 
  kable(booktabs = T,row.names=F, caption = "Results indicating food consumption as a function of dog size.") %>%
  kable_styling() %>%
  row_spec(color.me, bold = T, color = "green")
  
```

#### General information

You can run multiple statistical tests in chunks as above and even create your own tables based on results. You can get more information from the following resources:
