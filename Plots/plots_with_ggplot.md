Plots with ggplot
================

This document contains a series of plots I have had to create throughout
my employment. I created these plots using real data, however converted
this to dummy data due to data safety. The dummy data follows similar
patterns to real-life data, but it is not. This dummy data can be
plugged in to produce the plots created below (for code testing
purposes).

#### Plots showing proportion

The plot below produces a matrix indicating the correlation between a
parent’s measure of intelligence and their child’s. This is one of the
projects I have worked on, using family-structured data
(parent-offspring dyads). The percentage matrix created in the script
below is made-up data.

\*I think the plot looks better without a title; however, this line is
commented out to be implemented if needed.

#### Plots showing correlations

The plot below is somewhat similar to the plot above. This is the same
project as above, this time showing a matrix indicating the correlation
between polygenic risk scores and two measures of general intelligence
factors. The percentage matrix created in the script below is made-up
data.
