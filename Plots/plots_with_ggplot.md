Plots with ggplot
================

This document contains a series of plots I have had to create throughout
my employment. I created these plots using real data, however converted
this to dummy data due to data safety. The dummy data follows similar
patterns to real-life data, but it is not. This dummy data can be
plugged in to produce the plots created below (for code testing
purposes).

#### Plots showing effect size

In my line of work, we are often asked to produce plots to visualise the
size of effect a variable has when associated with another variable. The
example below shows two complex brain imaging metrics for diffusion MRI,
fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity; and their association with
two variables, “polygenic risk scores”. The purpose of the graph is to
observe how the two scores relate to each metric on a global and
regional level.

#### Plots showing proportion

The plot below produces a matrix indicating the correlation between a
parent’s measure of intelligence and their child’s. This is one of the
projects I have worked on, using family-structured data
(parent-offspring dyads). The percentage matrix created in the script
below is made-up data.
